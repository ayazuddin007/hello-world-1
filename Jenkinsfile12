//There are two important things here. First, a new stage (success) is added that simply set the result of the 
//current build to SUCCESS once it is done. It must be the last stage on the pipeline. 
//This could also be added as the last step of the last stage instead of adding a new stage, but I think it's clearer like this. 
//The second thing is the failure block in which the result of the current build is set to FAILURE. With these two things, 
//the Mailer plugin now sends notification when a build has been fixed.
